# Diabetes Detection using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project to detect diabetes in individuals based on key health indicators. The model uses various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

## Introduction
Early detection of diabetes can significantly improve patient outcomes and quality of life. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on their health indicators such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It contains 8 features and 1 target variable indicating whether an individual has diabetes or not.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves are also plotted to provide a comprehensive evaluation.
